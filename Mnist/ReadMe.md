üí° How to Use
- Training the Model
    - Navigate to Train Model.
    - Click Train New Model.
        - Wait for training to complete (may take a few minutes).
        - View the test accuracy and training plots.
    - Live Demo
        - Go to Live Demo.
        - Choose Draw or Upload:
        - Draw: Sketch a digit on the canvas.
        - Upload: Upload an image of a handwritten digit.
